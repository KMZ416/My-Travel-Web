                    <h1>What is Travelling?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.Travel can also include
                        relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Why do we travel?</h1>
                    <p>
                        We travel for various reasons, but it’s interesting to note that vacations are often referred to as “getaways.” Most often, we travel to get away from something — be it a bad job, a relationship, a stereotype, or just a nagging sense of wanderlust. Sometimes,
                        we don’t even realize that we are traveling to escape. But even just a short vacation to the beach or an unfamiliar city can serve as an escape — an escape from work, stress and responsibilities that we are weighed down with at
                        home.
